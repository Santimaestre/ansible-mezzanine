# Ansible playbooks for deploying a mezzanine application

This is an example that shows how to use Ansible to deploy a mezzanine site into
a Vagrant box.

To run it, do:

    vagrant up

Then point your browser to: http://www.192.168.33.10.xip.io or
https://www.192.168.33.10.xip.io. You'll get a security warning if you use the
https site since it's a self-signed certificate, this is normal.
